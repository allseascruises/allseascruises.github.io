      <div class="terms">
        <p>Access to and use of the services of All Seas Cruises & Travel, Inc. d/b/a All Seas (“ASCT” and/or “us/our”) is
          subject to acceptance of these terms and conditions (“Terms and Conditions”). These terms and conditions govern the
          relationship between ASCT and you, the purchaser and/or traveler (“Client” and “passenger” and “you/your”). By
          planning travel with ASCT, you agree to be bound by these terms and acknowledge that ASCT acts solely as a booking
          agent for disclosed principal supplier tour operators, cruise lines, hotels, airlines, air charters, bus companies,
          ground transportation, boat purveyors or owners, and other independent contractors providing accommodations,
          transportation, and/or other services (“Supplier(s)”), and is not the source or provider of the travel services. These
          terms include warranties and disclaimers and exclusions of liability and may restrict your rights and remedies and
          provide protection to ASCT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY PART OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, PLEASE DO NOT USE ASCT’S
          SERVICES. No alterations to these terms and conditions may be made by any ASCT authorized representative or agent,
          unless in writing by an authorized officer of ASCT.</p>
        
        <h3>1. USE OF ASCT SERVICES, ACCESS AND INFORMATION FOR TRAVEL BOOKINGS</h3>
        
        <p>You warrant that you are at least 18 years of age and possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and to
          make travel bookings with ASCT in accordance with all terms and conditions herein. You agree to be financially
          responsible for all of your travel bookings and warrant that all information supplied by you, on behalf of yourself,
          members of your household, or others for whom you are authorized to transact business with ASCT is true and accurate.
          You agree that you will only make legitimate reservations or purchases for you or for another person for whom you are
          legally authorized to act when transacting business with ASCT and its Suppliers, and acknowledge that, without
          limitation, any speculative, false, or fraudulent reservation is prohibited.</p>
        
        <p>All bookings are accepted by ASCT as agent for the travel Suppliers on your itinerary. Separate Supplier terms and
          conditions will apply to your reservation and purchase of travel-related goods and services that you select, and you
          understand and agree to abide by the terms and conditions of purchase imposed by any Supplier that you have selected
          as a service provider for your travel.</p>
        
        <h3>2. PAYMENTS AND CANCELATIONS</h3>
        
        <p>You shall be completely responsible for all charges, fees, duties, taxes, and assessments arising out of your travel
          bookings through ASCT. By submitting a credit card authorization form to ASCT, you agree to allow ASCT to use your
          payment method to purchase travel products from our Suppliers on your behalf.</p>
        
        <p>All payments for travel are due prior to departure according to each Supplier’s terms and conditions of booking. If
          final and full payment is not received by the applicable due date, reservations may be subject to cancelation and
          deposits may be forfeited. You understand that any violation of any such Supplier’s conditions of purchase may result
          in cancelation of your reservation(s) or purchase, in your being denied access to any flights, tours, hotels, cruises,
          or other travel services, in your forfeiting any monies paid for such reservation(s) or purchase. In some cases, there
          is NO REFUND once a booking is made and paid in full. You may not be entitled to a refund if you change or cancel your
          travel plans after confirmation of a booking. All cancelation requests must be sent to ASCT in writing. As a result of
          cancelation, ASCT’s and third-party Supplier’s cancelation penalties will apply, which are detailed in your travel
          documentation, and on each Supplier’s website. Cancelation fees will be charged to the credit card or other payment
          method you authorized to pay for travel services or deducted from the Supplier’s refund.</p>
        
        <p>EXCEPTING IN CASES OF FRAUD, YOU AGREE NOT TO FILE ANY DISPUTE WITH YOUR BANK OR CREDIT CARD COMPANY TO AVOID OR
          VIOLATE ANY BOOKING TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ASCT OR ITS SUPPLIERS, INCLUDING CANCELLATIONS OR CHANGES OF ITINERARY OR
          ARRANGEMENTS FOR REASONS BEYOND THE CONTROL OF ASCT OR ITS SUPPLIERS. IF YOU ATTEMPT TO CHARGEBACK, REVERSE OR
          RECOLLECT A PREVIOUSLY AUTHORIZED TRIP PAYMENT, ASCT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO COLLECT ALL ADDITIONAL COSTS, FEES AND
          EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH CHARGEBACK, REVERSAL OR RECOLLECTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ATTORNEY FEES.</p>
        
        <p>When you receive any and all travel documents, it is your sole responsibility to review and verify all information
          for accuracy. Contact ASCT immediately if changes or corrections are required. You acknowledge that it is your
          responsibility to review all documentation necessary for checking in with Suppliers on your itinerary.</p>
        
        <h3>3. TRAVEL DOCUMENTS, INCLUDING TSA AND DHS ACCEPTABLE IDENTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS</h3>
        
        <p>It is the responsibility of each Client to obtain and carry a valid passport, visa(s), and all other documents
          required by applicable government regulations. When traveling domestically or internationally, the U.S. Transportation
          Security Administration (TSA) and U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) advise that everyone carry at least two
          forms of acceptable identification in order to board a flight. Acceptable identification can be found at
          http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/acceptable-ids; examples are DHS-designated enhanced driver’s license,
          Passport, a foreign government passport. The name, date of birth and gender that appears on the identification card
          must exactly match the same such data that is listed on airline ticket(s) and booking records.</p>
        
        <p>ASCT strongly recommends that you take into account that certain countries will not admit a passenger if their
          passport expires within six (6) months of the date of entry. Non-United States citizens may require additional
          documentation. Client is responsible to make ASCT aware when traveling on a passport from a country other than the
          United States of America. ASCT neither controls nor warrants the issuance of visas or approval of visa waivers related
          to your travel. Should a visa not be issued, ASCT is not responsible for lost payments made toward the contemplated
          trip. Please note that rules of each country regarding entry and exit change on a daily basis.</p>
        
        <p>Children and infants also require travel documents. Minors traveling with one parent, and/or without both parents,
          may be stopped and not admitted, unless authenticated and verified consent forms are provided to the authorities;
          please see https://help.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-3643 for additional information.</p>
        
        <p>You acknowledge any failure to strictly comply with these requirements may result in denied boarding or an undue
          delay at an airport security checkpoint causing Client to miss flight(s), and subsequent scheduled travel bookings on
          cruises and tours. Check each Supplier’s website to ensure you and all members in your travel group or party obtain
          and carry travel documentation required.</p>
        
        <h3>4. INDIVIDUAL ENTRY AND EXIT REQUIREMENTS</h3>
        
        <p>Each country holds different views of past criminal offenses, whether within or outside of their boundaries. If you
          have a current or prior criminal offense, contact that country directly for entry and exit requirements. You can visit
          the US State Department Website for further information about these requirements. See,
          https://travel.state.gov/content/travel.html. We do not inquire about an individual’s criminal record in the interest
          of respecting our Clients’ privacy. For example, if traveling to or through Canada, individuals with a Driving While
          Intoxicated (DWI) record should review current entry requirements. See:
          http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/faq/inadmissibility/index.asp.</p>
        
        <h3>5. HAZARDOUS MATERIALS</h3>
        
        <p>Federal law prohibits passengers from bringing hazardous materials on the aircraft. (1) Federal law forbids the
          carriage of hazardous materials aboard aircraft in the passenger’s luggage or on the passenger’s person. A violation
          can result in five years’ imprisonment and penalties of $250,000 or more (49 U.S.C. 5124). Hazardous materials include
          explosives, compressed gases, flammable liquids and solids, oxidizers, poisons, corrosives and radio- active
          materials. Examples: Paints, lighter fluid, fireworks, tear gases, oxygen bottles, and radiopharmaceuticals. (2) There
          are special exceptions for small quantities (up to 70 ounces total) of medicinal and toilet articles carried in the
          passenger’s luggage and certain smoking materials carried on the passenger’s person. For further information, each
          passenger should contact the relevant airline representative(s) on their itinerary. Restrictions on hazardous
          materials are listed http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/prohibited-items.</p>
        
        <h3>6. INSECTICIDE NOTICE</h3>
        
        <p>We recommend that you refer to the DOT list of airports in countries that require airlines to treat the passenger
          cabin with insecticides prior to the flight or while on the aircraft. This list is on the DOT’s website and is updated
          from time to time: http://www.dot.gov/office-policy/aviation-policy/aircraft-disinsection-requirements.</p>
        
        <h3>7. HEALTH/IMMUNIZATIONS</h3>
        
        <p>You must have the proper immunizations and health screenings and required documentation of such immunizations and
          screenings before travel. ASCT shall not assume responsibility for the accuracy of health, vaccination, or
          documentation prior to departure or upon landing at the final destination. In some cases, required inoculations must
          be recorded by Client’s health practitioner on a valid vaccination certificate, which the Client must carry for proof
          of inoculation. If you are concerned about taking any medications or receiving certain inoculations, check with your
          health practitioner BEFORE booking. Check the State Department Web site http://travel.state.gov, for relevant
          information relating to travel to specific destinations, and the Center for Disease Control
          http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/ relating to health issues related to travel.</p>
        
        <h3>8. SELLER OF TRAVEL</h3>
        
        <p>ASCT is a Registered Seller of Travel in the State of Florida, Florida ST20808.</p>
        
        <h3>9. AIR TRAVEL, SCHEDULE RECONFIRMATION</h3>
        
        <p>UNLESS SET FORTH IN WRITING, AIRLINE RESERVATIONS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN YOUR TRAVEL PLANS. In such event, it is the
          Client’s responsibility to make appropriate air arrangements, as well as transportation to and from the destination
          where the travel booking originates and returns. ASCT shall not assume any responsibility for any air and/or ground
          schedule changes. In rare instances, upon departure from a country, certain departure taxes must be paid in cash only,
          and may vary in price. Failure to use a reservation may result in automatic cancelation of all continuing and return
          flights, as well as forfeiture of airfares.</p>
        
        <p>Airline e-tickets expire a year from issue date unless carrier fare rules in passenger’s itinerary fare provide
          otherwise.</p>
        
        <h3>10. CHECK-IN</h3>
        
        <p>Due to enhanced security, it is strongly recommended that you check in a minimum of 2 hours prior to scheduled
          departure for domestic flights and 3 hours prior to scheduled departure time for international flights. Reconfirm
          flight times at least 24 hours prior to scheduled departure time for domestic flights, and 72 hours prior for
          international flights.</p>
        
        <h3>11. RIGHT TO CORRECT ERRORS/OFFERS SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY</h3>
        
        <p>We reserve the right to correct errors. In the event of any pricing error or omission, we reserve the right to adjust
          such pricing or make any other corrections. All offers, incentives and Supplier promotions are subject to availability
          and may change without notice. Prospective Clients are advised to reserve early to avoid disappointment and additional
          late booking fees.</p>
        
        <h3>12. UNUSED ARRANGEMENTS, MINIMUM PASSENGER REQUIREMENTS AND ALTERATIONS TO BOOKINGS</h3>
        
        <p>When tour, cruise or package prices are based on Suppliers’ contract rates, you will not be entitled to any refund
          for any unused portion of travel.</p>
        
        <p>Some group tours are based on minimum numbers of passengers traveling; if the number of passengers falls below the
          minimum required, a surcharge may be imposed, or the tour may be canceled. Any cancelations of a tour or package for
          reason of failing to meet the minimum traveler requirement will be governed by the tour operator’s cancelation policy.
        </p>
        
        <p>If you decide to change any portion of your confirmed arrangements prior to departure or during your trip, we will
          attempt to assist you. Certain bookings may not be able to be changed. All requests for changes to a booking must be
          made in writing to ASCT.</p>
        
        <p>In the event of pandemic outbreaks, civil unrest or other health or safety concerns, once ASCT has investigated the
          prevailing situation, ASCT shall have the sole and absolute discretion whether to proceed with any ASCT escorted trip
          or private departure, or to make alterations to the itinerary.</p>
        
        <p>The Supplier may determine that alterations in itinerary are necessary for any number of reasons, including but not
          limited to severe weather. Any alterations to an itinerary are at the sole discretion of the Supplier, and ASCT bears
          no responsibility for any changes.</p>
        
        <h3>13. LIMITATIONS OF RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCLOSURE</h3>
        
        <p>ASCT acts solely as a booking agent for disclosed principal Suppliers, and is not the source or provider of any
          travel service. Each Supplier is an independent entity with its own management and is not subject to the control of
          ASCT. The Suppliers whose names appear in travel documentation are those actually responsible for providing the travel
          services purchased, and you consent to the use of those Suppliers.</p>
        
        <p>BECAUSE ASCT ACTS AS AGENT FOR DISCLOSED PRINCIPAL SUPPLIERS AND DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO CONTROL THE OPERATIONS OF
          SUCH INDEPENDENT OPERATORS AND SUPPLIERS, YOU AGREE THAT ASCT IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY
          DAMAGE, WHICH MAY ARISE OUT OF THESE SERVICES. ASCT HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT,
          STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL CONSEQUENTIAL,
          INCIDENTAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, IN CONNECTION WITH THE GOODS OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY ANY PRINCIPAL SUPPLIER BOOKING
          THROUGH ASCT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LIABILITY FOR ANY ACT, ERROR, OMISSION, INJURY, LOSS, ACCIDENT, DELAY OR
          IRREGULARITY WHICH MAY BE INCURRED THROUGH THE FAULT, NEGLIGENCE, WILFULL ACTS, OMISSIONS OR OTHERWISE OF SUCH
          SUPPLIER, OR OF ANY SUPPLIER OR THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SERVANTS, OR REPRESENTATIVES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
          LIMITATION, THEIR FAILURE TO DELIVER OR THEIR PARTIAL OR INADEQUATE DELIVERY OF SERVICES, THEIR CANCELATION AND REFUND
          POLICIES, FUEL INCREASES, BANKRUPTCY OR CESSATION OF OPERATIONS AND OTHER MATTERS OUTSIDE OF ASCT’S CONTROL, AND YOU
          HEREBY EXONERATE ASCT FROM ANY LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THE SAME.</p>
        
        <p>ASCT HAS SOLELY RECEIVED COMMISSION AND FEES FOR TRAVEL TRANSACTIONS AND CLIENT AGREES AND UNDERSTANDS THAT ANY
          RECOVERY FROM ASCT WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF COMMISSION AND FEES ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY ASCT.</p>
        
        <h3>14. RISKS / SAFETY</h3>
        
        <p>Travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others. ASCT urges Clients to remain informed on a daily
          basis as to current news events, as well as to review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements and advisories
          issued by the United States Government prior to booking travel to international destinations. Information on health
          and safety conditions in various countries and the level of risk associated with travel to particular international
          destinations can be found at http://www.state.gov, http://www.tsa.gov, http://www.dot.gov, http://www.faa.gov,
          http://www.cdc.gov, and http://www.cbp.gov The Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) is a free service provided by
          the U.S. Government to U.S. citizens who are traveling to, or living in, a foreign country. STEP allows you to enter
          information about your upcoming trip abroad so that the Department of State can better assist you in an emergency.
          Registration is recommended and provided by going to https://step.state.gov/step/</p>
        
        <p>BY OFFERING FOR SALE TRAVEL TO PARTICULAR DESTINATIONS, ASCT DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT TRAVEL TO SUCH POINTS
          IS ADVISABLE OR WITHOUT RISK, AND SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR COSTS, DAMAGES, OR LOSSES THAT MAY RESULT FROM TRAVEL TO
          SUCH DESTINATIONS. CLIENT’S PARTICIPATION CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH EVENTS AT CLIENT’S OWN RISK.</p>
        
        <h3>15. FORCE MAJEURE</h3>
        
        <p>ASCT will not be in breach of these terms and conditions or otherwise be liable to you, for any failure or delay in
          performing an obligation under this Agreement that is due to any of the following causes, to the extent beyond its
          reasonable control: acts of God, accident, riots, war, terrorist act, epidemic, pandemic, quarantine, civil commotion,
          breakdown of communication facilities, including web host and internet service provider, breakdown or malfunction of
          equipment, destruction of or serious damage to facilities, natural catastrophes including, but not limited to extreme
          weather events, floods and volcanic eruptions, governmental acts or omissions, changes in laws or regulations,
          national strikes, fire, explosion, generalized lack of availability of raw materials or energy, and any other
          unforeseen circumstance which is beyond the control of ASCT. THE PURCHASE OF TRAVEL INSURANCE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ON
          ALL TRIPS.</p>
        
        <p>In addition, each of ASCT’s Suppliers have terms and conditions which govern Client’s trip, and Client is advised
          that if travel Suppliers are affected by Force Majeure, they shall be entitled to, and may in their sole and absolute
          discretion, vary or cancel any itinerary or arrangement in relation to the trip. Payment of any refund to you as a
          result of the non-performance of any obligations hereunder shall remain in the sole and absolute discretion of the
          Supplier, although ASCT shall use its reasonable efforts to secure reimbursement for you where possible.</p>
        
        <h3>16. CLIENT CONDUCT</h3>
          
        <p>Each participant in any trip escorted by ASCT is expected to act responsibly and adhere to all
          behavior guidelines established by ASCT and our Suppliers. ASCT and all local Suppliers reserve the right to remove
          you from any facility, hotel or resort property, tour location or means of transportation if your health, or your
          conduct appears to endanger yourself or others or disrupts the general well-being of other clients on any element of
          your trip, or interferes with the operation or security of the places we visit. In any such case, there will be no
          refund. When you book with ASCT, you accept responsibility for any damage or loss caused by you. Full payment for any
          such damage or loss (reasonably estimated if not precisely known) must be paid directly at the time to the
          accommodation owner or manager or other Supplier. You must indemnify us for the full amount of any claim (also
          including legal costs) made against us. We are not responsible for any costs incurred concerning a guest removed from
          a trip, or any portion of a trip. You agree not to hold ASCT or any of its related entities liable for any actions
          taken under these terms and conditions. Baggage and personal effects are at all times the sole responsibility of the
          participant.</p>
        
        <h3>17. CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS</h3>
        
        <p>Currency exchange rates fluctuate. Prices are subject to change based upon currency exchange rate fluctuations,
          provided actual variations have occurred. ASCT is not responsible for surcharges or foreign transaction fees imposed
          by Client’s credit card or bank.</p>
        
        <h3>18. TRAVEL INSURANCE</h3>
        
        <p>ASCT OFFERS ACCESS TO TRAVEL INSURANCE TO PROTECT PASSENGERS AND THEIR INVESTMENT IN TRAVEL. UNLESS SPECIFICALLY
          NOTED, TRAVEL INSURANCE IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE COST OF CLIENT’S ITINERARY TO PROTECT AGAINST THIRD PARTY SUPPLIER
          DEFAULT/BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION, DELAY, INTERRUPTION, MISSED CONNECTION FOR CRUISES, CANCELATION, MEDICAL EMERGENCY
          TRANSPORTATION/EVACUATION & REPATRIATION, BAGGAGE & PERSONAL EFFECTS/LOST LUGGAGE & BAGGAGE DELAY, ILLNESS, JOB LOSS
          PROTECTION AND CHANGE OF PLANS, ACCIDENTAL DEATH AND DISABILITY, TRAVEL ACCIDENT/SICKNESS MEDICAL EXPENSES, AND MORE.
          PROPER INSURANCE MAY PROTECT YOU FROM FINANCIAL LOSS IN ALMOST ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. Without appropriate travel
          insurance, Client understands and agrees that if Client cancels or interrupts Client’s travel for any reason, portions
          of the trip/tour may not be refunded and ASCT’s and travel Suppliers’ cancelation penalties will apply resulting in
